# AI Tris Game Browser Extension

AI Color Tris is a 2D arcade game similar to other Tetris-like games, written in TypeScript using Pixi.js. The game runs as a browser extension in the side panel, allowing you to play while browsing other tabs. It features 14 different kinds of 3-box blocks in red or blue colors. The objective is to arrange falling blocks to create filled rows of the same color, which are then cleared from the grid.

- **14 different block types**: 6 straight + 8 bent patterns
- **Dual colors**: Red and blue blocks (28 total variants)

- **Color-based row clearing**: rows only clear when all boxes are the same color
