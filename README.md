# ai-tris-game
AI Color Tris is a 2D arcade game similar to other Tetris-like games, written in Typescript. The game is played with 12 different kinds of blocks, each consisting of 3 colored boxes (red or blue). The objective is to arrange the falling blocks in a way that creates filled rows of the same color, which are then cleared from the grid.
